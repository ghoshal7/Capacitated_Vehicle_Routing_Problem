# Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing_Problem
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem is one of the most important problems in logistics and distribution as well as in supply chain network. 
<br> The is a minimization problem, where the objective can be distance (total distance travelled minimization) or cost per unit distance (hence cost minimization) satisfying demands at different clients network. </br>
This notebook contains formulations and solution of such an optimization problem in Python using DOcplex library of IBM. The problem is solved using DOcplexcloud
